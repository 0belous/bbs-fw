## STC15W4K32S4
Running at 4.3V


#### PAS1
White  
5k external pullup resistor.

#### PAS2
Grey   
5k external pullup resistor.



#### BRAKE 
White
5V active low  
Conencted to to P2.4 on MCU via 0.6V diode for voltage drop?


#### THROTTLE
Blue
3k series resistor  
9k external pulldown on pcb  
Connected to P1.3 -> ADC3 on MCU


#### TX
Yellow  
680ohm series resistor  
0.6V diod paralell connected to 5V??  
Connected via some ic (level converter or protection?) to P4.7 (TxD2)

#### RX
Green  
Probably connected to P1.0 (RxD2)
