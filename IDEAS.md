# FIRMWARE IDEAS

I intend to make this firmware compatible with original bafang displays.

* A custom configuration tool with more options.
* Make use of speed sensor optional
* Make use of display optional.
* Make it possible to select to use throttle in pas 0.
* Make all assist levels individually configurable between: PAS, PAS + Throttle, Throttle Only, Cruise
* Configure each assist level max current/max travel speed individually.
* Switch to other "page" of assist levels by engaging sport mode (either by sport mode button combo or light button + pas 0 etc)
