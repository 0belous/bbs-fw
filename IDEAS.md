# FIRMWARE IDEAS

I intend to make this firmware compatible with original bafang displays.

* A custom configuration tool with more options.
* Make it possible to select to use throttle in pas 0.
* Make all assist levels individually configurable between: PAS, PAS + Throttle, Throttle Only, Cruise
* Make it possible to configure so that eco mode can limit max current/max speed.
* Make it possible to set startup mode to be with speed limit + current limit and engage offroad mode by engaging e.g. light and/or eco mode.
